/*
Dont use this file!!!!

Use the main "styles.scss" file in the "styles" folder

The reason is so that we can have a centralized location with styles that can be shared between
components. This will likely be extended to the webview as well because
we share the base logic for this with them

One downside of the centralized file is that we end up importing the material icon theme
for each component, which can become large, but we dont have to worry about streaming and
another few mb (if we have 10+ components) wont hurt
