# Server

This app handles the language server for the VS Code extension. The language server, and communication, is initialized by the client, but the logic and work is all done here.

> If you are new to language servers, see VS Code's documentation for more information [https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide).
