# assembling-tree-handlers

This library contains the instances of our tree callback handlers for styling and formatting our code.

The idea is that, eventually, we can grow these to have independent rule sets that can be easily switched out when we try to process data.

This follows the same pattern as our parsing and validation of code in the syntax tree to create an easily extendable/customizable code formatter.
