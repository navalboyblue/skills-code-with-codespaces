# Usage Metrics

This library contains the core logic that sets up and reports usage metrics. This is something that only happens if the user allows it to be enabled.

## Credits

Original API for sending metrics came from @analytics-debugger/ga4mp and can be found here:

https://github.com/analytics-debugger/ga4mp

Converted to typescript, fixed some bugs, added comments and types to make it more clear what was going on and how things worked.
