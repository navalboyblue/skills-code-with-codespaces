# Generating JSON Language Files

To generate the JSON language files, make sure you have the recommended extensions installed.

Then:

1. Open the `.tmLanguage` file in this repository

2. Open the command palette

3. Execute "Convert to tmLanguage JSON"

4. Ta-da!

These JSON language files can then be directly imported into `vitepress` in the main config.
