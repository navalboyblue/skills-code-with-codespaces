# Converting Your Notebooks

As of the time these docs were written, there are two ways that you can export/convert your notebooks: PRO code and PDFs.

## Converting Notebooks to PRO Code

There are two ways that you can convert a notebook to PRO code:

1. From an open Notebook, select the convert button in the top-right of the window (two criss-crossed arrows)

2. From the IDL Sidebar, and under "Notebooks", select "Convert IDL Notebook to PRO Code"

## Converting Notebooks to PDFs

> PDF conversion requires a 3rd party extension to create PDFs from your notebooks.
>
> The first time you try to create a PDF, it will be set up automatically if you agree.
>
> For setup and installation, or if you are having problems, see [PDF Generation](./pdf_generation)

Similar to PRO code conversion:

1. From an open Notebook, select the PDF button in the top-right

2. From the IDL Sidebar, and under "Notebooks", select "Convert IDL Notebook to PDF"
