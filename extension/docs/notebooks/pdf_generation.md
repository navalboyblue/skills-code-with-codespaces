# Notebook PDF Generation

In order to convert your notebook to a PDF, we use a 3rd party extension called "Markdown PDF".

The first time you attempt to create a PDF from a notebook, we will check to see if the extension is installed and, if not, ask if it should be.

One of the key items here is that, after the extension is installed, it will take a little longer to install chromium in the background.

If you have problems with installation, see Markdown PDF's [install guide](https://github.com/yzane/vscode-markdown-pdf?tab=readme-ov-file#install) for more details.

## Install Troubleshooting

If you are having problems installing, try this:

1. Uninstall Markdown PDF

2. Completely close and re-start VSCode (if you are on Mac, make sure to completely quit the process)

3. Manually install Markdown PDF

4. Wait for Chromium to be installed (you'll see an indicator in the status bar until it is finished)

5. Try converting a markdown file to a PDF to make sure it is working and configured correctly
