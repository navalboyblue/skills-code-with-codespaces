# Formatting

::: info

For those new to formatting their IDL code, we have several resources for you to learn how the different options work.

See [Configuration](/code-comments/formatting/configuration.md) and [Setup](/code-comments/formatting/setup.md) for more information.

## Background and Design

The goal of adding in formatting to our VSCode extension was to get to a place where developers have automated tooling to help them, and others, write consistent code.

While we have some options to help fine-tune the visual appearance (i.e. "style" of your code), the spacing and more mechanical display is going to be the same for every user.

As-is, we have some options that provide a balance with legacy controls you had in the IDL Workbench, but we likely won't add any more controls unless there are new language-level features that get added.

If you want to learn more about the spirit of our decision, check out the [design philosophy of Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/option-philosophy), which we modeled the IDL formatting after.
