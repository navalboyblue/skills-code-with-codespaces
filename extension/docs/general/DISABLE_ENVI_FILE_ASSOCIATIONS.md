# Disable ENVI File Associations

As part of the extension, we enable you do drag and drop image files into VSCode's display. When we detect common image formats, we open those in ENVI.

If you want to disable this, you can reset the file associations to their default values.

Here's how you do this:

1. Open the settings UI
2. Search for 'Editor Associations"
3. Enter the extension you don't want to open in ENVI ("\*.dat" for example)
4. Set the editor as "default"
5. Hit OK
6. Open a file with the extension and it should display in the editor without opening ENVI
