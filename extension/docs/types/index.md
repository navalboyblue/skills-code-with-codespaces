# Types

One of the more advanced features of the extension is that it can detect data types within your code.

This allows us to make more accurate auto-complete recommendations based on data types.

Types come from a few places:

1. IDL and ENVI documentation includes some automated guesses at most types.

These aren't perfect, so let us know if there is an error and we are happy to fix it!

2. From your code itself. This is where formatting and documentation come in so that we get the information we need to make it easier for you to program and stay organized.

3. Inferred types from things like addition, subtraction, array creation, etc.

## Getting Started with Types

The best way to start with types is to get AutoDoc configured with formatting on save.

Once you have that configured, check out our [starter guide](./types_tldr) to learn more.
