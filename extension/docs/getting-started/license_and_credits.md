- Icon theme:

  - The icon theme is directly from [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/main/extensions/theme-seti) and only modified to use a different icon for PRO files (use our own instead of the prolog owl icon). Credits and auxiliary files can be found in `./extension/icon-theme`.
