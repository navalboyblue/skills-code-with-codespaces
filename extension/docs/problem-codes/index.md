# Problem Codes

One of the most helpful features that is included as part of the VSCode extension is the ability to detect problems within your code without having to compile or run any code.

This specific tooling helps accomplish several things:

- Normalizes the way users write IDL code by trying to minimize the problems that get reported

- Saves you time from common mistakes that would normally be caught at run-time to help make you more productive

There are more than 100 problems that we detect and, to learn more about them, hovering over the problems in VSCode gives you some additional information.

You can find more detailed information about some of the problem codes in the documentation (but not all have been added).

You can either use the search functionality (top of the page) or the sidebar to the left to learn more about each code.
