# IDL Problem Code `72` with alias `duplicate-arg-kw-var-def`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem detects when there are two or more arguments or keywords with the same name.

Each argument, and keyword, should have a unique and different name.

Here is an example of this problem:

```idl{1,2}
function myFunc, arg, arg, kw1 = kw, kw2 = kw
  ;              ^^^  ^^^        ^^        ^^  duplicate arg or kw variable
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
end
```

Which can be fixed by changing the argument and keyword names:

```idl{1,2}
function myFunc, arg1, arg2, kw1 = kw1, kw2 = kw2
  ;              ^^^^  ^^^^        ^^^        ^^^  OK!
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
end
```
