# IDL Problem Code `59` with alias `docs-left-align`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/docs_error.md-->

This problem indicates that the documentation you have in your code is not consistent with the left-aligned spacing.

This matters because, when we parse your docs, the spacing indicates where we start parsing extracting text and your docs can be cut off.

Here's an example that highlights the problem:

```idl{7}
;+
; :Returns: Number
;
; :Arguments:
;   arg: in, required, Number
;     My favorite arg
;    is really cool
;
;-
function myfunc, arg
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42 + arg
end
```

To fix the issue, correct the left-alignment:

```idl{7}
;+
; :Returns: Number
;
; :Arguments:
;   arg: in, required, Number
;     My favorite arg
;     is really cool
;
;-
function myfunc, arg
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42 + arg
end
```
