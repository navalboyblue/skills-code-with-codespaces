# IDL Problem Code `83` with alias `docs-prop-too-many-params`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/docs_error.md-->

This problem indicates that the documentation for a structure property has more information than just the type.

At the time of writing this doc, the properties should only include the type and no additional information like arguments or parameters.

Here is an example of the problem:

```idl{3,5}
;+
; :MyStruct:
;   prop1: in, required, String
;     First property
;   prop2: in, required, Number
;     Second property
;
;-
pro MyStruct__define
  compile_opt idl2

  void = {MyStruct, prop1: '', prop2: 42}
end
```

Which can be fixed by removing everything else besides the type:

```idl{2,3,4,5,6}
;+
; :MyStruct:
;   prop1: String
;     First property
;   prop2: Number
;     Second property
;
;-
pro MyStruct__define
  compile_opt idl2

  void = {MyStruct, prop1: '', prop2: 42}
end
```
