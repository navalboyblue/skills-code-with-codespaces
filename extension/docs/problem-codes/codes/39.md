# IDL Problem Code `39` with alias `no-idl2`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/compile_opt.md-->

Here's an example of how to reproduce the error:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt hidden
  ; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ missing idl2

  ; ... logic

end
```

Which you can fix by adding in `idl2` as a compile opt:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt idl2, hidden

  ; ... logic

end
```
