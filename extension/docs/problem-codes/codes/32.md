# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `32` with alias `routines-first`

> Potentially fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling code

If you have routine definitions, then it validates that only routines or comments come before them. IDL does not allow variable creation outside of routine definitions.

```idl
a = 42
;  ^^^^ problem here

function myAwesomeFunc
  compile_opt idl2
end
```

To correct, remove your problem code:

```idl
function myAwesomeFunc
  compile_opt idl2
end
```
