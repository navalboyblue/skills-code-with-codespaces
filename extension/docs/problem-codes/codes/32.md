# IDL Problem Code `32` with alias `routines-first`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

If you have routine definitions, then it validates that only routines or comments come before them. IDL does not allow variable creation outside of routine definitions.

```idl
a = 42
;  ^^^^ problem here

function myAwesomeFunc
  compile_opt idl2
end
```

To correct, remove your problem code:

```idl
function myAwesomeFunc
  compile_opt idl2
end
```
