# IDL Problem Code `98` with alias `incomplete-ternary`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem indicates that a ternary operator is incomplete. Ternary operators are in-line if-then-else statements.

Here's an example of an incorrect ternary operator:

```idl
a = !true ? 'It is true'
;            ^^^^^^^ incomplete ternary
```

Which can be fixed by adding the second half:

```idl
a = !true ? 'It is true' : 'It is not true :('
;   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ OK!
```
