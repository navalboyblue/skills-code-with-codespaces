# IDL Problem Code `90` with alias `potential-type-incompatibility`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem, using types, identifies when you may have a fatal type incompatibility at runtime.

For example, when you try to add a `number` and an `object` together:

```idl
a = 1 + envi()
;   ^^^^^^^^^^ potential type incompatibility
```

To fix, correct your statement or re-write your code:

```idl
e = envi()
a = 1
```
