# IDL Problem Code `20` with alias `return-vals-pro`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This identifies return statements in procedures that have arguments (i.e. things they return) when that is not allowed.

```idl
pro myAwesomePro
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 21
  ;     ^^^^ problem here
end
```

The correct way to use `return` within procedures or procedure methods is:

```idl
pro myAwesomePro
  compile_opt idl2
  return
  ;     ^^^^ correct syntax is to not return anything
end
```
