# IDL Problem Code `69` with alias `unfinished-dot`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem is detected when you use the "dot" notation to access a property or method, but you don't specify the property or method.

Here's an example of this problem:

```idl{2,3}
p = plot(/test)
axis = p.
;      ^^ unfinished dot
```

And how to fix it:

```idl{2,3}
p = plot(/test)
axis = p.axis
;      ^^^^^^ OK!
```
