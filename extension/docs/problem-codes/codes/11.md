# IDL Problem Code `11` with alias `illegal-include`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

::: warning
This can be a fatal error, depending on where it is reported.

At a high level, this problem also helps ensure that include statements are only used in the right locations.
:::

This identifies include statements, such as `@my_file`, being used where they shouldn't be.

Here's an example:

```idl
a = myfunc(@bad)
         ; ^^^^ illegal include
```

The correct, but advanced, usage for include statements follows:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt idl2
  @include_some_file
  ; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  ; correct usage at the top level of
  ; a routine definition
end

```
