# IDL Problem Code `106` with alias `circular-include`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

::: warning
Include statements are an advanced concept in IDL and are not suggested for common use.

If you are using include statements consider using a procedure or function instead.

This identifies when a file that is included using `@some_file` creates a circular reference.

For example, take the contents of `filea.pro` which includes the contents of file b with `@fileb`:

```idl
a = 42
example = 'foobar-ed'
@fileb
; ^^^^ fileb imports filea and is circular
```

And the contents of `fileb.pro` which includes the contents of file a with `@filea`

```idl
b = 42
example = 'please dont do this'
@filea
; ^^^^ filea imports fileb and is circular
```

To fix this, correct the imports so they are not circular.
