# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `106` with alias `circular-include`

This identifies when a file that is included using `@some_file` creates a circular reference.

For example, take the contents of `filea.pro` which includes the contents of file b with `@fileb`:

```idl
a = 42
example = 'foobar-ed'
@fileb
; ^^ fileb imports filea and is circular
```

And the contents of `fileb.pro` which includes the contents of file a with `@filea`

To correct, use brackets instead and add `compile_opt idl2` to the routine:

```idl
b = 42
example = 'please dont do this'
@filea
; ^^ filea imports fileb and is circular
```
