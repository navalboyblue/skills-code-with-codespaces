# IDL Problem Code `46` with alias `unclosed-quote`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/docs_error.md-->

This error occurs when a single-or-double quote string does not have a closing quote.

Here's an example of this error:

```idl
a = 'The meaning of life is + strtrim(42)
;   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ unclosed quote
```

Which can be fixed by reducing to a single statment:

```idl
a = 'The meaning of life is' + strtrim(42)
;   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ OK!-
```
