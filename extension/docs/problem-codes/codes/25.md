# IDL Problem Code `25` with alias `duplicate-pro-method`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/inconsistencies.md-->

This identifies user-defined procedure methods that have more than one definition present.

Note that IDL is case insensitive when resolving routines and, once a routine is compiled or on IDL's search path, it can be accessed from anywhere.

```idl
pro myClass::myMethod
  ; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ duplicate procedure method

  ; ... logic here
end

pro myClass::myMethod
  ; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ duplicate procedure method

  ; ... logic here
end
```

To fix, change the name of your routine:

```idl
pro myClass::myMethod1
  ; ... logic here
end

pro myClass::myMethod2
  ; ... logic here
end
```
