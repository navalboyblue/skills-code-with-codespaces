# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `25` with alias `duplicate-pro-method`

> Potentially causes inconsistencies when IDL is running code, depending on your search path

This identifies user-defined procedure methods that have more than one definition present.

Note that IDL is case insensitive when resolving routines and, once a routine is compiled or on IDL's search path, it can be accessed from anywhere.
