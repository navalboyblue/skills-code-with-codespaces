# IDL Problem Code `62` with alias `docs-return-not-needed`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/docs_error.md-->

This problem indicates that the `:Return:` tag is present for a routine that does not return a value. This includes procedures and procedure methods.

Here's an example that produces this error:

```idl{2}
;+
; :Returns: Number
;-
pro mypro
  compile_opt idl2
end
```

To fix it, remove the tag from the docs:

```idl{2}
;+
;
;-
pro mypro
  compile_opt idl2
end
```
