# IDL Problem Code `74` with alias `duplicate-property`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem detects when there are two or properties in a structure with the same name.

Each structure property should have a unique name.

Here is an example of this problem:

```idl
struct = {a: 42, a: 'not that simple'}
;         ^      ^  duplicate structure tag
```

Which can be fixed by changing the names of the properties:

```idl
struct = {a: 42, b: 'not that simple'}
;         ^      ^  OK!
```
