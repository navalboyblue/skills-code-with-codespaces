# IDL Problem Code `102` with alias `potential-var-use-before-def`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem is the same as [`var-use-before-def`](./101.md), but is reduced in severity because of a common block being present.

This problem identifies when you use a variable before it has been defined.

Here's an example:

```idl
print, myVar
;      ^^^^^ used before def
myVar = 42
```

To fix, re-order or re-write your code:

```idl
myVar = 42
print, myVar
;      ^^^^^ OK!
```

If you are encountering this error in a catch block, see [Catch Blocks](./101.md#catch-blocks) for some ways to can resolve the issue.
