# IDL Problem Code `97` with alias `unknown-kw`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem indicates that you are using a keyword that is unknown. This means it is not in your source code or not in the documentation from IDL and ENVI.

<!--@include: ./severity/report_issue.md-->

Here's an example adding a made up keyword to a function call:

```idl
e = envi(/headless, /fake_keyword)
;                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ unknown keyword
```

To fix, remove from your code:

```idl
e = envi(/headless)
;        ^^^^^^^^^^ OK!
```
