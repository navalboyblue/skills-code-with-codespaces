# IDL Problem Code `93` with alias `ptr-nothing-to-de-ref`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem finds floating asterisks in your code that are being used in a way that indicates they are for de-referencing pointers.

Here is a reproduce case:

```idl
a = *
b = (*)
```

To fix, correct your statement or re-write your code:

```idl
a = *myPtr
b = (*myPtr)
```
