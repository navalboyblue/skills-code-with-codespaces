# IDL Problem Code `66` with alias `bad-continue`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This identifies `continue` statements that are not within `for`, `foreach`, `while`, or `repeat` loops.

Here's an example of the error:

```idl{4,5}
pro myAwesomePro
  compile_opt idl2

  continue
  ; ^^^^^^ bad continue statement
end
```

To fix the problem remove the `continue` statement or make sure it is used within a loop like so:

```idl{5,6}
pro myAwesomePro
  compile_opt idl2

  for i=0,99 do begin
    if i lt 50 then continue
    ;               ^^^^^^^^ OK!
  endfor
end
```
