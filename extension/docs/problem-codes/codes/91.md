# IDL Problem Code `91` with alias `illegal-index-type`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem, using types, identifies when a variable is being indexed using the wrong data type.

For example, when you try access elements of an array using an object reference:

```idl
a = [1,2,3,4]
b = a[plot()]
;   ^^^^^^^^^ illegal-index-type
```

To fix, correct your statement or re-write your code:

```idl
a = [1,2,3,4]
b = a[0:1]
;   ^^^^^^ OK!
```
