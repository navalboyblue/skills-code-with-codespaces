# IDL Problem Code `65` with alias `string-literal-too-many-args`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This error occurs when you pass in too many arguments for formatting content to be added to a string literal (template literal).

This error happens when you have code like this:

```idl
mystring = `${1.234, abc, "%10.3f"}`
```

And can be fixed by removing the additional argument:

```idl
mystring = `${1.234, "%10.3f"}`
```
