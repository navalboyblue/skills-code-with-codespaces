# IDL Problem Code `6` with alias `todo`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

This is an informational problem code that alerts the developer that they have left something "TODO" later.

TODO statements are parsed from comments of the form:

```idl
; TODO: something really awesome
; ^^^^^ is the location of the TO-DO statement
```
