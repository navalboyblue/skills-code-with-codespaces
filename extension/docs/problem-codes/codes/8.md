# IDL Problem Code `8` with alias `illegal-arrow`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

::: details Best Practice
For modern IDL programming, we prefer users use the dot notation instead of arrow.

::: code-group

```idl{2} [Dot (preferred)]
p = plot(/test)
p.save
```

```idl{2} [Arrow (not-preferred)]
p = plot(/test)
p->save
```

:::

This identifies arrow operators `->` where they shouldn't be encountered.

The arrow operator should only be used to call a routine method.

Here's an example of where this error gets reported:

```idl
p = plot(/test)
p->
;^^ illegal arrow
```

To fix it, add in the method call or remove the bad code:

::: code-group

```idl{2,3} [Fix: Add method]
p = plot(/test)
p->save
;^^^^^^ OK!
```

```idl{2,3} [Fix: Remove code]
p = plot(/test)
```
