# IDL Problem Code `36` with alias `reserved-pro-method`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/internal_routine.md-->

If you have a procedure method definition that conflicts with a core IDL definition, this gets reported.

```idl
pro IDLffVideoRead::Cleanup
  ; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ problem
end
```

To correct, rename your method as something else.

```idl
pro IDLffVideoRead::Cleanup2
  ; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ problem
  self.cleanup
end
```
