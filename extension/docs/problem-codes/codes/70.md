# IDL Problem Code `70` with alias `illegal-hex-escape`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem is detected when a standalone escape character is in place.

Here's an example of this problem:

```idl
a = `\x00 \XaF`
;         ^^^^ illegal hex escape
```

To fix this, remove the escape character

```idl{2,3}
a = `\x00`
;     ^^^^ OK!
```

## Allowed Escape Characters

Here's a short list showing allowed escape characters that you can use:

```idl
a = `\\`
a = `\$`
a = `\b`
a = `\f`
a = `\n`
a = `\r`
a = `\t`
a = `\v`
a = `\x00`
```
