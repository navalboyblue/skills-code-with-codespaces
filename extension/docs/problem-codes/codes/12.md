# IDL Problem Code `12` with alias `reserved-var`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This error gets reported when you name a variable that matches a reserved word.

There are some statements that for program control (and only that).

Here is an example:

```idl
a = for
;   ^^^ problem
```

To fix, change your variable name.

```idl
a = myAwesomeVar
;   ^^^ fixed!
```
