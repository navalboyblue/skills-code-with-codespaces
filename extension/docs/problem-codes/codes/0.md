# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `0` with alias `not-closed`

> This is a fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling code

This problem code appears when a statement, expression, or syntax is not properly closed.

For example, this error can be detected from function calls missing a closing parentheses:

```idl
a = myFunc(42
            ; ^^^ not closed
```

or when compound/block statements don't have an end:

```idl

; main level program

if !true then begin
  lifeMeaning = 42

; ^^^ no "endif" detected


end
```
