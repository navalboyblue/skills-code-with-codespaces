# IDL Problem Code `89` with alias `illegal-dictionary-op`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem, using types, identifies when you are using dictionaries in a way that is not allowed.

For example, when you try to add a `dictionary` and a `list` together:

```idl
a = dictionary() + list()
;   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ illegal dictionary op
```

To fix, correct your statement or re-write your code:

```idl
a = dictionary('my-list', list())
;   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ OK!
```
