# IDL Problem Code `100` with alias `potential-undefined-var`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem is the same as [`undefined-var`](./99.md), but is reduced in severity because of a common block being present.

Here is a reproduce case using a `foreach` loop on a variable that is not defined, but could be in a `common` block:

```idl
common, my_block
foreach val, var do print, val
;            ^^^ potentially undefined variable
```

To fix, check for typos and try again:

```idl
var = [1,2,3,4]
foreach val, var do print, val
;            ^^^ OK!
```
