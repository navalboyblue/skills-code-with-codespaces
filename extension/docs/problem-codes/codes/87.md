# IDL Problem Code `87` with alias `illegal-hash-op`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem, using types, identifies when you are using hashes in a way that is not allowed.

For example, when you try to add a `hash` and a `list` together:

```idl
a = hash() + list()
;   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ illegal hash op
```

To fix, correct your statement or re-write your code:

```idl
a = hash('my-list', list())
;   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ OK!
```
