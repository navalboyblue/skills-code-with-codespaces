# IDL Problem Code `40` with alias `illegal-comp-opt`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This issue detects when you specify a compile option for `compile_opt` that is illegal or does not exist.

> This problem code is meant to be used with the latest version of IDL which has some new compile options

Here's an example of how to reproduce the error:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt idl2, bad_opt
  ;                 ^^^^^^^ illegal compile option

  ; ... logic

end
```

Which you can fix by removing the bad option:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt idl2

  ; ... logic

end
```
