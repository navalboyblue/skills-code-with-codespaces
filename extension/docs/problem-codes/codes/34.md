# IDL Problem Code `34` with alias `empty-main`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

If you have a main level program, it cannot be empty.

```idl
; main level

end
```

To correct, add something else:

```idl
; main level
meaningOfLife = 42
end
```
