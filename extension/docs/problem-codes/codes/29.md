# IDL Problem Code `29` with alias `reserved-pro`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/internal_routine.md-->

This identifies when user-defined procedures match the same name as routines internal to IDL.

Here's an example:

```idl
pro writeu
  ; ^^^^^^ reserved procedure

  ; ... logic
end
```

To fix, change the name of your routine:

```idl
pro myWriteU
  ; ... logic
end
```
