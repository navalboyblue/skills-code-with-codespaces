# IDL Problem Code `94` with alias `ptr-de-ref-illegal`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem, using types, identifies when you are de-referencing a variable that is not a pointer.

Here is a reproduce case:

```idl
a = 5
b = *a
;   ^^ illegal de-ref
```

To fix, correct your statement or re-write your code:

```idl
a = 5
b = 42 * a
```
