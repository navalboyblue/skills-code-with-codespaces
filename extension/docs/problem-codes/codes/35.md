# IDL Problem Code `35` with alias `after-continuation`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/bug_alert.md-->

If you have a line continuation, and something besides a comment afterwards, this gets reported:

```idl
a = $ wrong
  ; ^^^^^^^ problem
  42
```

To correct, remove the code

```idl
a = $
  42
```

Technically anything after the line continuation is treated as a comment and ignored, but even IDL experts can accidentally introduce bugs this way by "commenting" out real code.
