# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `35` with alias `after-continuation`

> Potentially fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling code

If you have a line continuation, and something besides a comment afterwards, this gets reported:

```idl
a = $ wrong
  ; ^^^^^^^ problem
  42
```

To correct, remove the code

```idl
a = $
  42
```

> Pro tip: This is not a syntax error, but it helps catch accidental bugs. Technically anything after the line continuation is treated as a comment and ignored, but even IDL experts can accidentally introduce bugs from this.
