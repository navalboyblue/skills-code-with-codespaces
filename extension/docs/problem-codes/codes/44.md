# IDL Problem Code `44` with alias `unexpected-comma`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem code represents when we detect commas that are out of place.

Here's a reproduce case to create this problem and fix it:

::: code-group

```idl{3,4} [Problem]
pro myPro
  compile_opt idl2
  a = b[,]
  ;     ^ unexpected comma
end
```

```idl{3,4} [Fix]
pro myPro
  compile_opt idl2
  a = b[1]
  ;     ^ removed
end
```
