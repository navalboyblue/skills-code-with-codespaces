# IDL Problem Code `13` with alias `illegal-ternary`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This identifies ternary operators (i.e. `@!true ? 'true' : 'false'`) where they shouldn't be encountered.

```idl
!true ? 'yes' : 'no'
; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ illegal ternary not in an expression
```
