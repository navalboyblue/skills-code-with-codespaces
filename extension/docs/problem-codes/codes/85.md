# IDL Problem Code `85` with alias `illegal-struct-op`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem, using types, identifies when you are using structures in a way that is not allowed.

For example, when you try to add a structure and a list together:

```idl
a = {} + list()
;   ^^^^^^^^^^^ illegal structure op
```

To fix, correct your statement or re-write your code:

```idl
a = list({})
;   ^^^^^^^^ OK!
```
