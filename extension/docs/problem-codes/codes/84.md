# IDL Problem Code `84` with alias `illegal-subscript`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem, using types, identifies when you are using array-styles subscripting on a data type that does not allow it.

This applies to data structures such as, `hashes`, `orderedhashes`, and `dictionaries`.

Here is some code that reproduces the error:

```idl
a = hash()
b = a[1:3]
;    ^^^^^ illegal subscript
```

To fix, correct your statement or re-write your code:

```idl
a = hash()
b = a['my-key]
;    ^^^^^^^^^ OK!
```
