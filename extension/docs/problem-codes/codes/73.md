# IDL Problem Code `73` with alias `duplicate-kw-def`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem detects when two keywords have the same external name.

Here is an example of this problem:

```idl{1,2}
function myFunc, kw1 = kw1, kw1 = kw2
  ;              ^^^        ^^^  duplicate kw def
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
end
```

Which can be fixed by changing the external keyword name:

```idl{1,2}
function myFunc, kw1 = kw1, kw2 = kw2
  ;              ^^^        ^^^  OK!
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
end
```
