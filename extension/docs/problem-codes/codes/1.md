# IDL Problem Code `1` with alias `unexpected-closer`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem code appears when a closing statement appears unexpectedly.

For example, this error can be detected when we encounter the end of a block statement or closing parentheses when it was not started:

```idl
z = 42 )
    ; ^^^ unexpected closer
```

::: tip
If you encounter this problem code, check to see if you accidentally deleted an opening statement above. If not, remove it.
