# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `1` with alias `unexpected-closer`

> This is a fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling code

This problem code appears when a closing statement appears unexpectedly.

For example, this error can be detected when we encounter the end of a block statement or closing parentheses when it was not started:

```idl
z = 42 )
    ; ^^^ unexpected closed
```

> Pro tip: if you encounter this problem code, check to see if you accidentally deleted an opening statement above. If not, simply remove it.
