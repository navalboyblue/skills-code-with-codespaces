# IDL Problem Code `92` with alias `potential-arr-type-incompatibility`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem, using types, identifies when two arrays are being operated on that have incompatible types.

For example, when you try add together an array of numbers with an array of objects:

```idl
a = intarr(5) + objarr(5)
;   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ potential type incompatibility
```

To fix, correct your statement or re-write your code:

```idl
a = intarr(5)
b = objarr(5)
```
