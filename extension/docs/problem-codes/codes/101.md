# IDL Problem Code `101` with alias `var-use-before-def`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem identifies when you use a variable before it has been defined.

Here's an example:

```idl
print, myVar
;      ^^^^^ used before def
myVar = 42
```

To fix, re-order or re-write your code:

```idl
myVar = 42
print, myVar
;      ^^^^^ OK!
```

## Catch Blocks

If you are encountering this error in catch blocks, then you can try re-writing your code to follow the style of JavaScript/TypeScript try/catch blocks:

::: code-group

```idl{3,4} [Before]
catch, err
if (err ne 0) then begin
  print, myvar
  ;      ^^^^^ used before definition
endif
myvar = 42
```

```idl{5,6} [After]
catch, err
if (err eq 0) then begin
  myvar = 42
endif else begin
  print, myvar
  ;      ^^^^^ OK!
