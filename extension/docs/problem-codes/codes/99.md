# IDL Problem Code `99` with alias `undefined-var`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem, using types and documentation, identifies when you a variable you are interacting with has not been defined.

Your mileage may vary with this problem code, depending on how complete the docs are for your routines.

Here is a reproduce case using a `foreach` loop on a variable that is not defined:

```idl
foreach val, var do print, val
;            ^^^ undefined variable
```

To fix, check for typos and try again:

```idl
var = [1,2,3,4]
foreach val, var do print, val
;            ^^^ OK!
```
