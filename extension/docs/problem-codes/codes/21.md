# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `21` with alias `return-vals-func`

> Potentially fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling code

This identifies return statements in functions that have too many arguments (i.e. things they return) when only one value is allowed

```idl
function myAwesomeFunc
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42, 84
  ;         ^^^^ problem here
end
```

The correct way to use `return` within procedures or procedure methods is:

```idl
function myAwesomeFunc
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
  ;     ^^^^ correct syntax is to not return only one value
end
```
