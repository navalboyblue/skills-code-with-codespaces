# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `27` with alias `duplicate-struct`

> Potentially fatal error if the underlying structures differ in their properties

This identifies user-defined structures that have more than one definition present.

Note that IDL is case insensitive when resolving structures and, once a structure is compiled/defined, it can no longer be changed.
