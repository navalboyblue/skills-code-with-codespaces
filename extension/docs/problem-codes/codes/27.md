# IDL Problem Code `27` with alias `duplicate-struct`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/inconsistencies.md-->

::: danger
If your structures have different properties and property types, then this will cause problems
:::

This identifies user-defined structures that have more than one definition present.

Note that IDL is case insensitive when resolving structures and, once a structure is compiled/defined, it can no longer be changed.

Here is an example of problem code and how to fix it:

```idl
pro myclass__define
  ; ^^^^^ duplicate procedure

  !null = {MyStruct, property: 42}
  ;        ^^^^^^^^ duplicate structure
end

pro myotherclass__define
  ; ^^^^^ duplicate procedure

  !null = {MyStruct, property: 42}
  ;        ^^^^^^^^ duplicate structure
end
```

To fix, change the names of your structures:

```idl
pro myclass__define
  ; ^^^^^ duplicate procedure

  !null = {MyClass, property: 42}
end

pro myotherclass__define
  ; ^^^^^ duplicate procedure

  !null = {MyOtherClass, property: 42}
end
```
