# IDL Problem Code `76` with alias `init-method-pro`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

::: danger Warning
This causes weird behaviors when creating object classes in IDL.

While not a bug, it can leave you scratching your head and spending cycles to fix the problem.
:::

This problem detects when the `::init` method for an object class is a procedure and not a function.

Here is an example of this problem:

```idl
pro myclass::init
;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ should be func method
  compile_opt idl2
end
```

To fix, change the procedure to a function call:

```idl
function myclass::init
;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ OK!
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 1
end
```
