# IDL Problem Code `38` with alias `no-comp-opt`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/compile_opt.md-->

Each routine and main level program should have a `compile_opt idl2` statement present to control how IDL interprets default numbers and array indexing.

Adding `compile_opt idl2` is a long-standing best practice and IDL for VSCode has automation to fix this problem on file save so you don't have to add this to every routine.

Here's an example of how to reproduce the error:

```idl
pro myPro
; ^^^^^^^ missing compile_opt idl2
  ; ... logic

end
```

Which you can fix by adding in `compile_opt`:

```idl
pro myPro
  compile_opt idl2

  ; ... logic

end
```
