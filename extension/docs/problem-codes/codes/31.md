# IDL Problem Code `31` with alias `return-missing`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This identifies when `return` statements in functions are not present.

```idl
function myAwesomeFunc
  ;  ^^^^ problem here
  compile_opt idl2
end
```

The correct way to use `return` within functions or functions methods is:

```idl
function myAwesomeFunc
  compile_opt idl2
  return, 42
  ;     ^^^^ correct syntax is to not return only one value
end
```
