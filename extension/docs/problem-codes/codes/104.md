# IDL Problem Code `104` with alias `unused-var`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

::: tip
This problem helps keep your code clean
:::

This problem detects when you create a variable but do not use it.

We can re-create this issue by defining a variable and not doing anything with it:

```idl
foo = 'bar'
;^^ unused variable
```

To fix, remove the variable or use it somewhere else:

```idl
foo = 'bar'
print, foo
```
