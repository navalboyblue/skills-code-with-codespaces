# IDL Problem Code `16` with alias `double-token`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This identifies when there are two tokens of the same type right next to each other.

This covers many types of errors, but most likely indicates that you forgot to include a statement that separates two items.

```idl
!null = a b
        ;^^^^^^^ Duplicate token from two variables without something in-between
```

To fix, remove the second or add something between them:

```idl
!null = a + b
```
