# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `3` with alias `after-main`

> This is a fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling code

This problem code is encountered if you have a statement, other than a comment, after the end of a main level program.

For example:

```idl

compile_opt idl2
super = 'cool string'
end

; comments are OK

; anything else is not
statments = bad
; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ problem raised here

```
