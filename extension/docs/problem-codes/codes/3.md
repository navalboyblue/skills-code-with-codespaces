# IDL Problem Code `3` with alias `after-main`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem code is encountered if you have a statement, other than a comment, after the end of a main level program.

For example:

```idl
compile_opt idl2
super = 'cool string'
end

; comments are OK

; anything else is not
statments = bad
; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^ problem raised here
```
