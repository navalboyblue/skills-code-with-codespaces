# IDL Problem Code `86` with alias `illegal-list-op`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem, using types, identifies when you are using lists in a way that is not allowed.

For example, when you try to add a `list` and `hash` together:

```idl
a = list() + hash()
;   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ illegal list op
```

To fix, correct your statement or re-write your code:

```idl
a = list(hash())
;   ^^^^^^^^ OK!
```
