# IDL Problem Code `24` with alias `duplicate-func`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/inconsistencies.md-->

This identifies user-defined functions that have more than one definition present.

Note that IDL is case insensitive when resolving routines and, once a routine is compiled or on IDL's search path, it can be accessed from anywhere.

```idl
function myFunc
  ;      ^^^^^^ duplicate function

  ; ... logic here

  return, 1
end

function myFunc
  ;      ^^^^^^ duplicate function

  ; ... logic here

  return, 1
end
```

To fix, change the name of your routine:

```idl
function myFunc1
  ; ... logic here

  return, 1
end

function myFunc2
  ; ... logic here

  return, 1
end
```
