# IDL Problem Code `78` with alias `illegal-chain`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This problem detects when you have function methods chained together in a way that IDL doesn't support.

Each structure property should have a unique name.

Here is an example of this problem:

```idl
a = myvar.method1().method2()
;         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ illegal chain
```

You need to wrap the result from the first chain in parentheses in order to fix this:

```idl
a = (myvar.method1()).method2()
;    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ OK!
```
