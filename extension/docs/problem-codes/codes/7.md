# IDL Problem Code `7` with alias `unknown-token`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/execution_error.md-->

This generic error catches any expressions or code that is detected where it isn't expected. For example, catching parentheses in function definitions:

```idl
pro myPro, arg1, arg2, ()
                     ; ^^ illegal parentheses
```

This is a catch-all problem code that is used when we have an unexpected token that we do not expect to see.

Here is a list of specific unknown tokens we encounter:

- [idl(8): illegal-arrow](./8.md)
- [idl(9): illegal-comma](./9.md)
- [idl(10): illegal-colon](./10.md)
- [idl(11): illegal-include](./11.md)
- [idl(13): illegal-ternary](./13.md)
- [idl(17): illegal-struct](./17.md)
- [idl(18): illegal-paren](./18.md)
- [idl(19): illegal-bracket](./19.md)

::: info
This is a catch-all for specific tokens that don't have their own problem codes.
