:::

This problem detects when a class definitions routine (procedures that end with `__define`) have arguments or keywords.

While this is not a syntax error, the procedures that contain structure definitions shouldn't have any parameters.

This is because, when IDL resolves structure definitions from the search path, the procedure is called by itself.

Here's an example of this problem:

```idl{1,2}
pro MyClass__define, arg1, arg2, kw1 = kw1
  ;                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ no parameters
  compile_opt idl2
end
```

Which can be resolved by removing the parameters:

```idl{1,2}
pro MyClass__define
  ;                ^^^^ OK!
  compile_opt idl2
end
```
