# IDL Problem Code `109` with alias `implied-print-nb`

::: info Informational Problem
This is a "problem" that gets reported to let users know how we are interpreting code in notebooks.
:::

This reported error indicates that there are IDL statements, not contained in routines, that will be automatically printed when we run the notebook cell.

The behavior is similar to the IDL Console where we automatically wrap your code with `print, myStatement, /implied_print`

There's no actions for you when this appears!
