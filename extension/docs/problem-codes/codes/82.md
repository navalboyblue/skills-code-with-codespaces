# IDL Problem Code `82` with alias `docs-prop-too-few-params`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

<!--@include: ./severity/docs_error.md-->

This problem indicates that the documentation for a structure property does not include the type of the property.

Here is an example of the problem:

```idl{3,5}
;+
; :MyStruct:
;   prop1:
;     First property
;   prop2:
;     Second property
;
;-
pro MyStruct__define
  compile_opt idl2

  void = {MyStruct, prop1: '', prop2: 42}
end
```

Which can be fixed by adding the types of the properties to the docs:

```idl{2,3,4,5,6}
;+
; :MyStruct:
;   prop1: String
;     First property
;   prop2: Number
;     Second property
;
;-
pro MyStruct__define
  compile_opt idl2

  void = {MyStruct, prop1: '', prop2: 42}
end
```
