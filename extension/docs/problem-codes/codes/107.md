# IDL Problem Code `107` with alias `unknown-disabled-alias`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

::: info
This is a helper problem that makes sure you don't have any issues trying to disable problems from being reported.

A little bit like problem-ception.
:::

This problem indicates that, when you are disabling problems, you specified an alias for a problem that doesn't exist.

You can recreate this problem by using our disable API with an incorrect alias:

```idl
; idl-disable foo-bar
; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ unknown problem "foo-bar"
```

To fix, correct the name/alias of the problem or remove your code:

```idl
; idl-disable no-comp-opt
; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ OK!
```
