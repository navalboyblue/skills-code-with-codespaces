# IDL Problem Code `77` with alias `unknown-structure`

<!--@include: ./severity/disable_problem.md-->

::: danger Execution Error
This is a fatal error that prevents IDL from compiling or running code

However, the extension only picks up structure definitions within `*__define` procedures which follows the IDL pattern.
:::

This problem detects when a named structure is being created, but IDL for VSCode is not aware of it.

Here's an example:

```idl
struct = {MyUnknownStructure}
;         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ unknown structure
```

To fix you either need to correct the name of the structure, or put your structure definition in a "\_\_define" method.

::: code-group

```idl [Fix structure name]
struct = {!map}
;         ^^^^ OK!
```

```idl{7,8,9,15,16} ["__define" procedure]
;+
; Save file as "myknownstructure__define" and save to current VSCode workspace
;-
pro MyKnownStructure__define
  compile_opt idl2, hidden

  ; define structure
  void = {MyKnownStructure, prop1: '', prop2: 42}
  ;       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ IDL finds this definition automatically
end

; main level program
compile_opt idl2

struct = {MyKnownStructure}
;         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ OK!
end
```
