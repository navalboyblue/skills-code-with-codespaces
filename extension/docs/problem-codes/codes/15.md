# [IDL Problem Code:](./../README.md) `15` with alias `colon-in-func-method`

This identifies when we have a function method call that contains the colon operator inside.

It indicates that you should likely be using brackets to index your arrays and not parentheses.

```idl
!null = myvar.thing(1:42)
                   ;^^^^^^^ Colon in function
```

To fix, swap out your parentheses with brackets:

```idl
!null = myvar.thing[1:42]
                   ;^^^^^^^ Yippee, no problem!
```
